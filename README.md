## Airgead Banking

This was a compound interest investment calculator app. It was project two of our C++ class at SNHU.

### Scenario
Congratulations! You have completed the interview process and have been hired as a junior developer at Chada Tech. Now that you have successfully completed your new-hire orientation and have been introduced to the rest of your team, you are ready to jump in and start working on your first project.

You are asked to collaborate with Airgead Banking, one of Chada Tech’s clients. Airgead Banking is well known in the community. They often sponsor schools and have recently decided to partner with the local high school to develop a program that will teach students the concepts of fiscal responsibility (such as living within their means and spending less than they make) via an interactive system. The initial focus for this project will be on investing and the power of compound interest. You will develop an application that allows users to see how their investments will grow over time. Airgead Banking has provided you with a list of functional requirements that describe what they need their application to do.
